NAME

	_printf - custom implementation of the printf function

SYNOPSIS

	#include "main.h"

	int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION

	The _printf function is a custom implementation of the standard printf function.
	It takes a format string and a variable number of arguments,
	and prints the formatted output to the standard output.

which are replaced by the arguments passed to the function. The format specifiers are:

%c: character

%%: percent sign

RETURN VALUE+

	The _printf function returns the number of characters printed.

			Writes a single character to the output.
