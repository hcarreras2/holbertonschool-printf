NAME

    _printf - custom implementation of the printf function

SYNOPSIS

    #include "main.h"

    int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION

    The _printf function is a custom implementation of the standard printf function. 
    It takes a format string and a variable number of arguments, 
    and prints the formatted output to the standard output.

FORMAT STRING

The format string is a character string that contains format specifiers, 
which are replaced by the arguments passed to the function. The format specifiers are:

%c: character
%s: string
%d: decimal integer
%i: integer
%%: percent sign

RETURN VALUE+

    The _printf function returns the number of characters printed.

HELPER FUNCTIONS

    The following helper functions are used by _printf to perform specific tasks:

    write_char

        int write_char(va_list list);

            Writes a single character to the output.

    write_string

        int write_string(va_list list);

            Writes a string to the output.

    write_number

        int write_number(va_list list);

            Writes a number to the output.

    print_mod

        int print_mod(va_list list);

            Prints a modifier (e.g., %, +) to the output.

    get_op

        int get_op(const char *format, va_list list);

            Gets the next operation from the format string and performs it.

    _putchar

        int _putchar(char c);

            Writes a single character to the standard output.
